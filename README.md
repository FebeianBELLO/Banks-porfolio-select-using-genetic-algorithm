### project overview
---
The Banks-Portfolio-Selection-Using-Genetic-Algorithm project aims to optimize the selection of Nigerian bank stocks to achieve the highest potential returns while managing risk. This project employs genetic algorithms (GAs), which are inspired by evolutionary processes like natural selection, to efficiently navigate and identify optimal portfolio configurations. By balancing returns and risks, this approach is designed to offer robust and data-driven financial strategies for investors.

### Data sources 
---
The data used in this project was sourced from ng.investing.com, which provides comprehensive  historical stock prices of five (5) banks, covering daily closing stock prices from 2021 to 2023.
### Tools
---
The tools used in this project were primarily Python-based:

    Pandas: For data import, cleaning, and manipulation.
    NumPy: For numerical calculations, including returns and risk calculations.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and charting.
    SciPy: For optimization functions.
    DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python): To implement the genetic algorithm for portfolio optimization.
    Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and reporting.
### Methods 
   - Problem Definition: Define the objective of maximizing returns and minimizing risk in a bank portfolio.

   - Data Collection & Preprocessing:
       -- Collect historical stock prices of selected banks.
       -- Calculate daily returns and historical returns for different periods.
       -- Normalize data for consistency.

  -  Genetic Algorithm Design:
       -- Define chromosome representation (weights of stocks).
      --  Set initial population of portfolios.

-    Fitness Function: Calculate the Sharpe ratio to evaluate the portfolios' risk-return efficiency.

   - Genetic Operations:
      --  Selection: Choose the best-performing portfolios.
        --Crossover: Combine portfolios to create new ones.
        --Mutation: Introduce small changes to maintain diversity.
        --Elitism: Retain the top portfolios for the next generation.

    -Iterative Evolution: Evolve portfolios over multiple generations, selecting, crossing over, and mutating until convergence.

    -Portfolio Evaluation: Select the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio as the optimal solution.

    -Results Interpretation: Analyze the optimal portfolio's return, risk, and Sharpe ratio.

    Comparison with Mean-Variance Portfolio: Compare the GA-optimized portfolio to a mean-variance portfolio for performance assessment.

    Conclusion: Summarize the genetic algorithm's effectiveness in optimizing portfolio allocation.

This process is tailored to optimize returns and minimize risk using genetic algorithms, as you did in your study of Nigerian bank stocks.
### key features
---
- Optimizes portfolio allocation by minimizing risk while maximizing return using a genetic algorithm approach.
-Provides risk-return profiles that help investors choose the optimal allocation of bank stocks there by increasing return and reducing loss.
-Compares genetic algorithm-based portfolios with traditional mean-variance optimization methods
-Analyzes financial performance metrics such as risk, return, and Sharpe ratios for each portfolio.
-Enables better decision-making for portfolio managers through data-driven insights.
-Highlights the most efficient portfolio based on a higher Sharpe ratio.
### key Analysis 
---
- Risk-Return Tradeoff: The genetic algorithm generates multiple portfolios with varying risk-return profiles to determine the optimal stock allocation.
-Performance Comparison: The portfolios generated by the genetic algorithm are compared to the mean-variance optimized portfolio to evaluate the effectiveness of each method.
-Portfolio Efficiency: The genetic algorithm helps identify portfolios that deliver high returns relative to the amount of risk undertaken, making them more efficient than traditional methods.
-Sharpe Ratio Optimization: Each portfolio is assessed using the Sharpe ratio, which measures return per unit of risk, identifying which portfolio delivers the best balance of risk and reward.

### Analysis findings 
---
- The highest peak occurred on November 26, 2015, with 261 customers. The busiest times were at 12 PM and 7 PM, each with 40 orders.
- The "ckn_alfredo" pizza had the highest quantity purchased, totaling 897 units.
- The majority of sales revenue was recorded in July, totaling $72,558. The specific day was  July 4, 2015, with the peak hour at 1 PM. A total of 4,301 orders were placed in July.
- The lowest peak occurred on December 31, 2015, with 73 orders. The busiest hour was 11 AM, with 17 orders placed and a total of 82 quantities of products sold, generating $1,338 in total sales.
- Customer Order Patterns between 2 PM and 1 PM, consistently showed higher order volumes compared to other times.

### Recommendations
---
- Ensure adequate staffing and inventory levels on high-traffic days like November 26 and July 4. Given the peak hours at 12 PM, 1 PM, and 7 PM, focus on these times for staffing adjustments and ingredient stock.
- Highlight the "ckn_alfredo" pizza in marketing campaigns and promotions, considering its high sales volume. Introduce special deals or combos featuring this popular item to boost sales further.
- Capitalize on the high sales revenue in July by launching seasonal promotions. Consider offering summer-themed pizzas or discounts during this peak month to attract more customers and increase revenue.
- Analyze and implement strategies to boost sales on low-traffic days like December 31. Consider special New Yearâ€™s Eve promotions or limited-time offers to encourage more orders.
- Since order volumes are higher between 12 PM and 1 PM, introduce lunch specials or discounts during these hours to attract more customers and increase order sizes.
- Focus marketing efforts on time slots between 12 PM and 1 PM, which show consistently higher order volumes. Implement time-limited offers or happy hour deals during these periods to maximize sales.
- Strengthen loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases, Offer exclusive deals or early access to promotions for loyalty program members.
- Use data insights to tailor promotions and marketing campaigns.
